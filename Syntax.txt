Nova Language Syntax


Changing syntax of programming languages

1. Reversed assignment operator  a + b : a

Allows assignment to flow from left to right like we write

in more natural direction

2. Tagging keywords  <while> ... </while>

This allows to easy introduce new keywords into language

and to easy find mistakes in control flow of program

It offers flexibility of markup languages and rigor of programming ones

3. Reversed function declaration:  <fun> int a, int b : f int  and  call:  a, b : f
 
These changes allow to seamlessly combine input and output in one line

Where "in :" is input and " : out" is output


Comments start with symbols "//" 


Supported operators:

"+" sum

"-"  substruction

"*"  multiplication

"/"  division

"%" mod (reminder of division of one integer by another)


Following types of variables supported

"int"  integer

"float"  float decimal

"char" character

"string" array of "char"

"bool" boolean "true" or "false"


Variable declaration and initialization 

int i    declaration without initialization

int(0)  declaration with initialization value of i becomes 0

char c

char c("a")

bool l(true)

string s("abcde")


"for" loop syntax explanation "<for>i(0)++ <n"
"i(0)" means initial value of iterator "i" is 0
"i(0)++" means iteration by 1
" < n" means upper limit of iteration


Array

int a[n]  declaration of integer array with n elements

int a[4]([1, 2, 3, 4])  declaration with initialization

a[i]  i-th member of array "a" indexing starts with 0

Operations on arrays

int n(4)

int a[n]

0 : a[0]

<for> i(0)++ < n - 1

a[i] + 1 : a[i+1]

</for>


main function declaration

<fun> string args[] : main int

args[] are arguments that go into main function
